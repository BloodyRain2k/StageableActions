StageableActions
================
Ever forgot to blow off your fairings when leaving the atmosphere?
Or to get rid of a stage that's meant for orbital insertion but not for finishing the circulization?
Or do you just keep forgetting to open the solarpanels?

Well here's the solution: Stageable Actions.
